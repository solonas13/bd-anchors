Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

This installation requires the pre-installation of the cmake tool,
a C++ compiler, and the libraries: libdivsufsort, sdsl, and boost.

For Linux, you can install libraries libdivsufsort, sdsl, and boost via

$ ./pre-install.sh 


Basic Instructions
==================


The shell command `make -f Makefile.64-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program. You can use `make -f Makefile.32-bit.gcc' instead. The latter 
is suitable for shorter texts and requires less memory.


After compilation the binary `search' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

$ ./search <dictionary> <ell> <pattern> <K> <tau> <delta>

Currently, the program supports only tau=0 and delta=0.

For example, the output of
$ ./search ./data/dictionary.txt 3 ./data/pattern.txt 2 0 0

is: 

 Parameters: ell = 3, K=2, tau=0 delta=0
 (In future versions there will be support for tau>0 and delta>0)
 Edit distance: 2
 String       : WAAVCCDE
 Edit distance: 0
 String       : AAVLCDE
 Elapsed total time (ms) : 0
 Avg time per query (ms) : 0

This means that for K=2 we obtain as answer 
the strings WAAVCCDE and AAVLCDE from dictionary.txt whose edit distance 
from the pattern in pattern.txt is 2 and 0 respectively. 
Please see the code for disabling the edit distance computation should you need 
to speed up the program for large inputs.
