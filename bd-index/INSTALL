Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

   This installation requires the pre-installation of the cmake tool,
a C++ compiler, and the libraries: libdivsufsort, sdsl, and boost.

For Linux, you can install libraries libdivsufsort, sdsl, and boost via

 $ ./pre-install.sh 

Basic Instructions
==================

   The shell command `make -f Makefile.64-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program. You can use `make -f Makefile.32-bit.gcc' instead. The latter
is suitable for shorter texts and requires less memory.

After compilation the binary `index' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

 $ ./index ./data/text 3 ./data/patterns
