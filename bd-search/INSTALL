Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

This installation requires the pre-installation of the cmake tool,
a C++ compiler, and the libraries: libdivsufsort, sdsl, and boost.

For Linux, you can install libraries libdivsufsort, sdsl, and boost via

$ ./pre-install.sh 


Basic Instructions
==================

The shell command `make -f Makefile.64-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program. You can use `make -f Makefile.32-bit.gcc' instead. The latter 
is suitable for shorter texts and requires less memory.

After compilation the binary `search' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

$ ./search <dictionary> <ell> <pattern> <K> <tau> <delta>

Currently, the program supports only tau=0 and delta=0.

For example, the output of

$ ./search ./data/dictionary.txt 5 ./data/pattern.txt 3 3 3

is: 

 Parameters: ell = 5, K = 3, tau = 3, delta = 3
 Pattern: ACTTACACACACTACAAAAAGAGTGTTTCAAACCTGCTCTGTGAAAGGGAATGTTCAATTCTGTGACTTGAATGCAATCATCACAAAGAACTTTCTGAGA

 Elapsed total time (ms) : 0
 Avg time per query (ms) : 0

This means that for K = 3 we obtain as answer the three strings from dictionary.txt 
whose edit distance from the pattern in pattern.txt is 6, 5, and 4 respectively.
