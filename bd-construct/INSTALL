Basic Instructions
==================

   The shell command `make -f Makefile.64-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program. You can use `make -f Makefile.32-bit.gcc' instead. The latter
is suitable for shorter texts and requires less memory.

After compilation the binary `construct' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

 S ./construct ./data/text 64
