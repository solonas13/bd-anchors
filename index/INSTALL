Pre-installation Instructions
=============================

   This installation requires the pre-installation of the cmake tool,
a C++ compiler, and the libraries: libdivsufsort and sdsl.

For Linux, you can install libraries libdivsufsort and sdsl via

 $ ./pre-install.sh 

Basic Instructions
==================

   The shell command `make -f Makefile.32-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program for 32-bit integers. 
   
   The shell command `make -f Makefile.64-bit.gcc' should compile this 
program for 64-bit integers. This requires double the amount of memory.

After compilation the binary `maw' will be created in the working 
directory, e.g. you may call it from this directory via

 S ./maw -a DNA -i ./data/1.fasta -o 1.fasta.out -k 2 -K 10
